    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I've been a digital humanities practitioner for over twenty years, as a
    designer, developer, researcher, and teacher. In my current role as Head of
    Research and Development in the <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu"
    rel="external">Scholarsâ€™ Lab</a> I provide consultation and collaboration
    support for digital humanities related initiatives. My current research
    includes feminist interface design for digital collections, homebrewed
    adaptations of fictional and historical materials for <em>Dungeons and
    Dragons</em>, and connecting bibliographies to different types of card decks
    and games.</p>
    <p>Some projects I've helped develop include the Praxis Program, Speaking in
    Code, Neatline, Take Back the Archive, Accessible Futures, Omeka, Zotero,
    and THATCamp.</p>
